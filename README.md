# MNIST_js
This exercise is part of the excellent course ["Browser-based models with Tensorflow.js"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow/home/welcome) with deeplearning.ai and Laurence Moroney available in Coursera.

## Getting Your System Ready

In this exercise I have run all the examples and exercises locally on your machine. If you need to reproduce the code, you will need to have an internet browser, an HTML editor, and a web server installed on your machine. Throughout this exercise we are going to use Chrome as our internet browser,  Brackets as our HTML editor and the Web Server for Chrome App as our web server. All of these are free and are available for various platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

## Motivation
With this repo we will create a convolutional neural network that can classify the images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset through Tensorflow.js

## Structure
- script.js
- data.js
- mnist.html

Hope you find this repo useful.

Keep learning!
